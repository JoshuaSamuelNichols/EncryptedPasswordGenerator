## Project Description
This Python-based application provides a sophisticated solution for generating strong and secure passwords. It combines alphanumeric characters with special symbols and includes letter-to-number substitutions to enhance security. The application features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) made with `tkinter`, allowing users to easily generate and copy passwords with a single click.

## Features
- **Secure Password Generation**: Creates robust passwords by blending uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Letter Substitution**: Enhances security by replacing certain letters with similar-looking numbers or symbols (e.g., 'a' becomes '4', 'e' becomes '3').
- **Clipboard Functionality**: Allows users to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard with the press of a button.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features a straightforward GUI that is easy for anyone to use, regardless of their tech proficiency.

## Prerequisites
Before you run the password generator, ensure you have the latest Python installed and the `pyperclip` module, which can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install pyperclip

```
